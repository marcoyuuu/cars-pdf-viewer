# Welcome to the Cars PDF Viewer App ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). This app allows users to view car-related PDFs and images in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Features

- View car-related PDFs stored in the `assets/cars/pdfs` directory.
- Browse car images located in the `assets/cars/images` directory.
- Interactive UI components for a seamless user experience.

## Project structure

- **app/**: Contains the main application code, including file-based routing and screens.
- **assets/**: Stores static assets like car images, PDFs, and fonts.
- **components/**: Reusable UI components.
- **constants/**: Application-wide constants.
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks for managing app logic.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for project maintenance.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
